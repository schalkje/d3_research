## Next Steps

1. **Start with BaseNode** - Create demo and run basic tests
2. **Progress through each node type** - Following the specified order
3. **Document issues** - Track any problems found
4. **Fix issues** - Address problems as they're discovered
5. **Validate fixes** - Ensure fixes don't break existing functionality
6. **Update documentation** - Keep documentation current

This testing plan ensures systematic validation of each node type while maintaining consistency across the entire system.

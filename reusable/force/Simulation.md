# ETL Dashboard:

## Column asignment
- nodes with no incomming edged, should be aligned to the left: column 1
- Starting from each of these starting nodes we will assign an order number: column; traversing the directed graph
    - if a node already has a column number leave it unchanged

Nodes can never leave their column

## Column ordening
Now we are going to order the nodes within their column

Start with the node having the most outgoing links

Assign a row number

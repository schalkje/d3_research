### Functional Requirements for Network Graph Node Nesting

1. **Hierarchy Representation**:

   1.1 **Parent-Child Relationship**: 
   - Nodes must represent hierarchical relationships, with **parent nodes** acting as containers for **child nodes**. 
   - A child node can only have one parent. Nesting can occur at multiple levels, allowing parents to also be children of higher-level nodes.

   1.2 **Expandable/Collapsible Parent Nodes**: 
   - Users must be able to **expand** or **collapse** nested nodes to reveal or hide child nodes. When collapsed, only the label of the parent node is shown, with children hidden.

   1.3 **Parent Size Adjustment**:
   - Parent nodes should dynamically adjust their size based on the number and positioning of their children. The size adjustment occurs when nodes are expanded or collapsed.

   1.4 **Dynamic Canvas**:
   - The entire layout must be dynamic, scaling with the necessary room for all nodes. The canvas resizes when parents or nodes are expanded or collapsed.

2. **Collision Handling**:

   2.1 **Node-Level Collision**:
   - Detect and handle collisions at both the individual node level and the container level to prevent overlap between nested structures and other nodes.

   2.2 **Nested Collisions**:
   - Child nodes should interact only within their container and must not collide with nodes outside their parent unless explicitly linked.

3. **Force Simulation Considerations**:

   3.1 **Boundary Constraints**:
   - Enforce both global boundaries for the canvas and local boundaries for parent nodes, ensuring children remain within their container.

   3.2 **Force Distribution**:
   - Adapt repulsion, attraction, and linking forces to respect nested contexts and ensure appropriate interactions.

4. **Link Handling**:

   4.1 **Internal vs External Links**:
   - Distinguish between **internal links** (links between nodes within the same parent) and **external links** (links between nodes in different containers or between a parent and a child).

   4.2 **Link Pathing**:
   - Adapt the paths for links connecting nodes across different containers to improve clarity and avoid overlapping boundaries.

5. **User Interaction**:

   5.1 **Dragging and Zooming**:
   - Allow users to drag parent nodes along with their children, maintaining relative positioning. Children must stay within their parent's boundaries when dragged.

   5.2 **Zoom Behavior**:
   - Adjust zoom to focus on specific areas, centering on a nested group if needed, while scaling nodes proportionally.

   5.3 **Drill down**
   - It should be possible to select a parent and "drill-down", making that parent the toplevel element in the visualisation
   - After drill-down it should be possible to drill-up again


6. **Rendering**:

   6.1 **Visual Nesting**:
   - Use **shaded backgrounds** or **borders** to clearly distinguish parent nodes from child nodes, emphasizing the containment relationship.

   6.2 **Labels and Annotations**:
   - Include labels for parent nodes to provide context, with child nodes also having distinct identifiers for improved comprehension.

7. **Layout Requirements**

   7.1 **Layout Modes**:
   - Layout within a group can be either **dynamic** or **fixed**.

   7.2 **Dynamic Layout**:
   - Child nodes within a parent container can move and adjust their position based on forces like repulsion and attraction, allowing for flexible and self-organizing structures.

   7.3 **Fixed Layout**:
   - Child nodes maintain a fixed position relative to their parent container, ensuring consistent and predictable layouts. This mode is suitable for scenarios where stability and clarity are prioritized.

   7.4 **Mixed Mode**:
   - Allow a mix of dynamic and fixed layouts within the same graph depending on the level of nesting and user interaction needs.

### Implementation Points

1. **Data Model Adjustments**:
   - Update the data model to include parent-child relationships with properties such as `children` or `parentId`.
   - Position child nodes relative to their parent's coordinates.

2. **Collision and Boundary Forces**:
   - Modify existing collision and boundary forces to effectively manage nested nodes, ensuring context-aware behavior.

3. **Force Simulation Updates**:
   - Consider running separate simulations for parent and child nodes to maintain smooth interactions within and between nodes.

4. **Custom Forces for Nesting**:
   - Implement a **containment force** to ensure that child nodes stay within their parent's boundaries.
   - Add an **alignment force** to maintain a structured arrangement of child nodes within their parent container.

### Challenges and Considerations

1. **Performance**:
   - The added forces and calculations due to nesting may impact performance, particularly in large graphs. Consider optimization techniques such as **quadtree** to improve efficiency.

2. **Edge Cases**:

   2.1 **Cyclic Relationships**:
   - Handle cyclic relationships carefully to maintain hierarchical integrity.

   2.2 **Mixed Structures**:
   - Ensure correct sizing and alignment of nodes for both nested and non-nested structures.

3. **User Experience**:

   3.1 **Visual Cues**:
   - Provide clear visual indicators to differentiate parent nodes from child nodes.

   3.2 **Navigation Management**:
   - Efficiently manage zoom and pan behaviors to facilitate seamless navigation through nested structures.

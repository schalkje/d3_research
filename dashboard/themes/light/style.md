## Light Theme â€“ Concept and Guidance

### Heart of the Style
- **Clean, minimal aesthetic**: Pure white backgrounds with subtle gray surfaces for depth and hierarchy.
- **High contrast readability**: Dark text on light backgrounds ensures excellent legibility and accessibility.
- **Professional simplicity**: Clean borders and subtle shadows create a polished, corporate-friendly appearance.
- **Typography**: Clear, readable text with consistent contrast ratios for optimal readability.
- **Motion**: Subtle and purposeful interactions that maintain the clean aesthetic.
- **Accessibility**: Strong contrast ratios and clear visual hierarchy for all users.

### Color Scheme (by Effect, not Names)
- **Base canvas**: Pure white (#ffffff) for maximum brightness and clean appearance.
- **Surface**: Light gray (#f7f7f8) for subtle depth and visual separation.
- **Text**: Deep black (#0b0b0c) for maximum readability and contrast.
- **Accent**: Modern blue (#2f6feb) for focus, selection, and important interactive elements.
- **Edges**: Muted blue-gray (#7795D1) for connections that are visible but not overwhelming.
- **States**: Use accent colors and border variations to communicate status without cluttering the clean design.

### Element Guidance
- **Nodes/containers**: Light surface fills with accent-colored borders. Selection emphasizes the accent color.
- **Edges**: Clean, single-weight lines in the edge color with subtle arrowheads.
- **Labels**: Dark text on light backgrounds for optimal readability and contrast.
- **Minimap**: Semi-transparent white background with subtle borders for integration.

### Interaction & States

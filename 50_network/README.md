You can define your own force functions but D3 comes with a number of useful ones built in:

- forceCenter (for setting the center of gravity of the system)
- forceManyBody (for making elements attract or repel one another)
- forceCollide (for preventing elements overlapping)
- forceX and forceY (for attracting elements to a given point)
- forceLink (for creating a fixed distance between connected elements)

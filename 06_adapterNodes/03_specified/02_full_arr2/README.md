# Full Arrangement 2 - Explicit Children

## Overview

This test demonstrates an adapter node with **full mode arrangement 2** layout (transform-focused) using **explicitly defined children**. This arrangement emphasizes the transform node while maintaining the full three-node structure.

## Features

- ✅ **Transform-focused layout** (arrangement 2)
- ✅ **Explicit child definitions** with transform emphasis
- ✅ **Advanced state management** (Active, Running, Idle, Pending)
- ✅ **Enhanced transform node** with special styling
- ✅ **Analytics-focused workflow** with ML transformation
- ✅ **Transform-first data flow** pattern

## Layout Configuration

```javascript
layout: {
    mode: "full",           // Full adapter with all nodes
    arrangement: 2,         // Transform-focused layout
    displayMode: "full"     // Full display mode
}
```

## Explicit Children Structure

### Child Nodes
1. **Staging Node** (`DWH.STG_INPUT`)
   - Role: `staging`
   - State: `Active`
   - Dataset ID: 201

2. **Archive Node** (`DWH.ARC_BACKUP`)
   - Role: `archive`
   - State: `Idle`
   - Dataset ID: 202

3. **Transform Node** (`DWH.TRF_ANALYTICS`) **[EMPHASIZED]**
   - Role: `transform`
   - State: `Running`
   - Dataset ID: 203
   - Special styling and animation

### Data Flow (Transform-Focused)
```
STG_INPUT → TRF_ANALYTICS → ARC_BACKUP
```

## Key Differences from Arrangement 1

| Aspect | Arrangement 1 | Arrangement 2 |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Focus | Archive-focused | Transform-focused |
| Layout | Archive prominent | Transform prominent |
| Flow | Staging → Archive/Transform | Staging → Transform → Archive |
| Emphasis | Archive storage | Analytics processing |

## Testing

Enhanced testing suite includes:

- ✅ Dashboard initialization
- ✅ Node rendering validation
- ✅ **Arrangement 2 layout verification**
- ✅ **Transform-focused flow validation**
- ✅ **Running state animation test**

### Key Test Cases

1. **Arrangement 2 Test**: Verifies layout is configured for arrangement 2
2. **Transform Focus Test**: Validates transform node prominence
3. **Flow Pattern Test**: Confirms transform-first data flow

## Visual Features

- **Transform node highlighting**: Special border and background
- **Running state animation**: Pulsing effect for active processing
- **Transform-focused color scheme**: Warm colors emphasizing analytics
- **Enhanced transform description**: ML and analytics emphasis

## Usage

1. Open `02_full_arr2.html` in a browser
2. Observe the transform-focused layout
3. Note the running animation on the transform node
4. Use controls to test functionality
5. Run tests to validate arrangement 2 behavior

## Comparison with Other Arrangements

| Feature | Arr 1 | **Arr 2** | Arr 3 |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Primary Focus | Archive | **Transform** | Staging |
| Layout Style | Balanced | **Transform-centric** | Staging-first |
| Data Flow | Parallel | **Sequential** | Fan-out |

## Development Notes

- Transform node receives special visual treatment
- Data flow follows a more linear staging → transform → archive pattern
- Enhanced state management with "Running" animation

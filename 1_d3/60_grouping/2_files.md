1. Data Model Files
- [x] dataModel.js: Define the structure for nodes, including properties such as children, parentId, label, and styling attributes. Should include helper functions to manage relationships like adding/removing children or managing metadata.
- [ ] sampleData.json: Provide a sample dataset representing the multi-level nesting, useful for testing and validating the visualization.
2. Components
- [x] __NodeComponent.js__: Create modular components for individual nodes, including visual and interactive behavior for both parent and child nodes.
- [ ] __ParentNodeComponent.js__: Implement the container component for nodes that act as parents, handling expandable/collapsible behavior, boundary constraints, and rendering child nodes.
- [ ] __ExpandableBehavior.js__: A reusable component for handling expandable and collapsible actions across the graph.
- [ ] __DrillDownComponent.js__: Manage drill-down interactions, isolating the view to children of a selected parent node.
3. Force Simulation
- [ ] forceSimulation.js: Handle the force-directed layout for the network graph. This file will implement the custom forces:
- [ ] containmentForce.js: Implement a custom force that keeps child nodes within their parent boundaries.
- [ ] alignmentForce.js: Maintain structural alignment of nodes within a group.
- [ ] collisionForce.js: Manage collision detection between nodes to prevent overlap.
- [ ] simulationHelper.js: Utility functions to manage the different simulations for parent and child nodes separately.
4. Collision and Boundary Handling
- [ ] collisionHandler.js: Algorithms for detecting collisions between nodes and nested containers, and enforcing boundaries for individual nodes and parent containers.
- [ ] boundaryConstraints.js: Implement boundary rules for both local (parent containers) and global (canvas edges) boundaries.
5. User Interaction
- [ ] interactionManager.js: Manage user interactions such as dragging nodes, zooming, and focusing on specific areas. Should include functions like:
- [ ] dragHandler.js: Manage node dragging while maintaining child positioning.
- [ ] zoomFocus.js: Handle zoom interactions to maintain focus on specific sections or nested groups.
- [ ] drillDown.js: Drill-down interaction logic to isolate a parentâ€™s children for a detailed view.
6. Rendering
- [ ] renderEngine.js: Core rendering engine using SVG or Canvas. Includes functions for drawing nodes, parent containers, links, and ensuring transitions during expand/collapse.
- [ ] nodeRenderer.js: Render logic specific to individual nodes, including visual cues, labels, and annotations.
- [ ] parentRenderer.js: Render logic for parent nodes, including shaded backgrounds or borders to distinguish from child nodes.
7. Layout Mechanisms
- [ ] layoutManager.js: Implement different layout mechanisms, managing both dynamic and fixed layouts for nodes within containers. Should include mixed mode logic that allows for combined dynamic and fixed layouts based on user preferences.
8. Performance Optimization
- [ ] performanceOptimizer.js: Include methods such as quadtree for collision optimization, selectively rendering nodes, or managing visibility of nodes based on user interaction.
- [ ] lazyLoader.js: A utility for selectively loading nodes based on the current viewport or user interactions to manage performance in large graphs.
9. Testing
unitTests/:
nodeTests.js: Test the node components, including node rendering, interaction, and force application.
forceSimulationTests.js: Validate force simulations and ensure behaviors like collision, containment, and alignment are working correctly.
integrationTests/:
componentIntegrationTests.js: Test interactions between components like expanding nodes and layout updates.
userTests/:
usabilityTests.md: Document testing scenarios for usability, covering zoom, drag, expand/collapse, and drill-down features.
10. Deployment and Configuration
Dockerfile: Define the container environment to deploy the application consistently across different environments.
docker-compose.yml: Compose configuration for services such as the graph rendering engine and other back-end services.
monitoringConfig.js: Logging and monitoring configuration to gather data on user interactions and performance for continuous improvement.
11. Main Entry Files
index.html: HTML entry point for the application. Should include links to necessary scripts and stylesheets.
app.js: Main JavaScript entry point, initializing the application, setting up the data model, and instantiating necessary components for the visualization.

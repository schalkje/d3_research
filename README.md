# Flow Dashboard (FlowDash)

## Overview

**FlowDash** is a production-ready data flow visualization dashboard built with D3.js. It provides advanced capabilities for visualizing data processes, ETL pipelines, and data lineage through an interactive, modular interface.

The project has evolved from experimental D3.js components into a comprehensive dashboard solution that combines the best practices learned from component development with real-world data visualization needs.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Dashboard
1. **View the Dashboard**: Open `dashboard/flowdash-bundle.html` in your browser

### Component Exploration
- Open `index.html` (generated by `generateIndex.ps1`) for a browsable index of all examples
- See each subfolder's `README.md` for details on the components and demos
- Run `python -m http.server 8000` and go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to view the pages

### Development
- **Run Tests**: Use `npm test` to execute the test suite
- **Development Server**: Use `npm start` for development mode with hot reload

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

- **Build**: `npm run build` - Production build
- **Test**: `npm test` - Run all tests
- **Component Tests**: `npm run test:adapter`, `npm run test:foundation`, etc.
- **Development Server**: `npm start` - Development mode with webpack

### Build Tools & Scripts

#### CSS Distribution Script
The `scripts/copy-flowdash-css.ps1` PowerShell script manages CSS distribution for the FlowDash dashboard:

**Purpose**: Copies FlowDash CSS files and themes to a distribution directory for deployment or packaging.

**Usage**:
```powershell
# Basic usage - copies to dashboard/dist/
.\scripts\copy-flowdash-css.ps1

# Specify custom destination
.\scripts\copy-flowdash-css.ps1 -DistRoot "C:\my-deployment\css"

# Clean existing files before copying
.\scripts\copy-flowdash-css.ps1 -Clean

# Use repository root from different location
.\scripts\copy-flowdash-css.ps1 -RepoRoot "C:\other-repo"
```

**What it does**:
- Copies `dashboard/flowdash.css` to the distribution root as `flowdash.css`
- Recursively copies all `.css` files from `dashboard/themes/` to `dist/themes/`
- Preserves the original folder structure
- Creates destination directories as needed
- Optionally cleans existing CSS files before copying

**Parameters**:
- `-RepoRoot`: Source repository root (defaults to script's parent directory)
- `-DistRoot`: Destination directory (defaults to `dashboard/dist`)
- `-Clean`: Remove existing CSS files before copying

**Use Cases**:
- Preparing CSS files for production deployment
- Creating clean distribution packages
- Syncing CSS changes to external systems
- Automated build processes

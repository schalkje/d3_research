# Flow Dashboard (FlowDash)

## Overview

**FlowDash** is a production-ready data flow visualization dashboard built with D3.js. It provides advanced capabilities for visualizing data processes, ETL pipelines, and data lineage through an interactive, modular interface.

The project has evolved from experimental D3.js components into a comprehensive dashboard solution that combines the best practices learned from component development with real-world data visualization needs.

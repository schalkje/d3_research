# Lane Node - Dynamic Addition Demo

## Overview

This demo showcases a Lane node with 1 initial rectangular child node and a button to add additional nodes dynamically, demonstrating dynamic child management and layout adjustment capabilities.

## Features

- **Lane Container**: Single lane node with dynamic child management
- **Initial Child**: 1 rectangular child node to start
- **Add Node Button**: Interactive button to add new child nodes
- **Dynamic Layout**: Automatic layout adjustment when nodes are added
- **Incremental Growth**: Sequential addition of child nodes
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate visual feedback when nodes are added

## Test Coverage

This demo includes automated tests that validate:
- Dashboard initialization
- Initial single child rendering
- Add node button functionality
- Dynamic layout adjustment
- Child node management
- Layout recalculation

## Node Structure

```
lane1 (Lane Node)
├── rect1 (Initial child)
├── rect2 (Added via button)
├── rect3 (Added via button)
└── ... (Additional nodes)
```

## Dynamic Addition Behavior

When nodes are added dynamically:
- New child nodes are created with unique IDs
- Layout automatically recalculates to accommodate new nodes
- Vertical stacking is maintained
- Horizontal centering is preserved
- Proper spacing is maintained between all nodes

## Interactive Features

- **Add Node Button**: Adds a new rectangular child node
- **Dynamic Updates**: Immediate layout recalculation
- **Sequential Addition**: Each click adds one new node
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of new node addition
